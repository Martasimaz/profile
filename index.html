    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I AM <strong>DYNAMIC</strong>, <strong>VERSATILE</strong>, <strong>PRAGMATIC</strong> and <strong>FAST LEARNER</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>ALSO <strong>HANDS-ON</strong>, <strong>METHODIC</strong>, <strong>SUPORTIVE</strong> AND <strong>RELIABLE</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>COMFORTABLE IN <strong>MULTI-TASKING</strong> WITH BIG <strong>ATTENTION TO DETAIL</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>CONSTANTLY SEEKING <strong>NEW IDEAS</strong> TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE <strong>BUSINESSGROWTH</strong>.   
      <br>
      <br>In the last few years, my professional and personal life has been in London, where I left to grow my career and as an individual, always to return to Portugal. Currently, I am in Lisbon looking for an opportunity to settle back in.
      <br>
      <br>My last PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE was in events management, where I was leading a team, and managing events up to 450 delegates in the largest conference hotel in the UK. 
          Throughout this most recent period, I have started exploring new professional alternatives, and I have found the IT world very stimulating, challenging and full of opportunities. So I have signed up to do a web development intensive course (boot camp) to develop my developer skills and knowledge to add to what I have been learning through my professional experience and kick off my new career.
      <br>
      <br>On the PERSONAL SIDE, I am a strong, and very motivated person driven to achieve my goals. I am dedicated and passionate about everything I do, and I always find the bright side of things.
      In my free time, I keep a healthy routine, practice sports and cook alternative dishes. On the laziest days, I land on my couch and bunge watch my Netflix favourite shows.
      <br>
      <br>Please find bellow my professional details for your consideration. I remain at your disposal for any further questions that may come up and/or participate in any face-to-face interview or through a video call.
    <p>AVAILABLE TO START IMMEDIATELY</p>
